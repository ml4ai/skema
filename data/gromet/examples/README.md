## File Types in Example Directories

The following files appear in the simple GroMet examples (not all have been generated for every example).

The following are likely of most interest:

- `*.py` : The source code file.
- `*--Gromet-FN-auto.json` : The GroMEt JSON representation as automatically generated by the export script.

The following represent "internal" and intermediate representations:

- `*--Gromet-FN-meta.json` : A manually-edited gromet to remove a bug associated with dicts, bug will be removed in future versions, but initial support is aviable now. 
- `*--Gromet-FN-no_lists.json` : A manually-edited gromet which expands out lists, for debugging purposes only.
