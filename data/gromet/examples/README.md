## File Types in Example Directories

The following files appear in the simple GroMet examples (not all have been generated for every example).

The following are likely of most interest:

- `*.py` : The source code file.
- `*_gromet_FN_manual_diagram.pdf` : A manual drawing of the gromet wiring diagram
- `*--Gromet-FN-auto.json` : The GroMEt JSON representation as automatically generated by the export script.

The following represent "internal" and intermediate representations:

- `*--AC-GrFN.json` : GrFN 2.3 JSON representation.
- `*--AC-GrFN.json` : GrFN 2.3 rendered (graphviz) as a graph with containers.
- `*--CAST.json` : The JSON export for the _base_ CAST (Common Abstract Syntax Tree) -- the base level of CAST as it is extracted from a front-end (Py2CAST, GCC2CAST).
- `*--Gromet-FN-manual[version].json` : A manually-constructed representation of GroMEt; used only for dev.
- `*-AnnCast.pdf` : A PDF rendering (graphviz) of the annCAST (annotated CAST, representing the CAST after running the CAST annotation pipeline (sequence of inference passes) that augment CAST to extract dataflow).
