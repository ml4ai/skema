## Equation images &rarr; pMML

Published docker images include our latest model release for converting images of equations to pMML.  When developing and testing new models for this conversion, make sure that the appropriate `img2mml` model is in the `skema/img2mml/trained_models` directory before building.  See the 
[`skema/img2mml` README for details](https://github.com/ml4ai/skema/blob/main/skema/img2mml/README.md).
