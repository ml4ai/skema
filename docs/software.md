We are developing a number of open-source software components as part of this
project. They are listed below:

- [https://github.com/ml4ai/skema](https://github.com/ml4ai/skema): This repository contains the code for the
  following capabilities:
    - Machine reading of scientific literature
    - Alignment of metadata
    - Comment extraction from source code
    - MathML parsing
    - Scientific model visualization (MOVIZ)
    - Structural alignment of code and equations
    - SKEMA web service that exposes many of the above capabilities via a REST
      API.
- [https://github.com/ml4ai/funman](https://github.com/ml4ai/funman): This repository contains the code for the
  FUNMAN module, which performs functional model analysis on scientific model
  code.
