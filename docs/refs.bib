  abstract	= { The study of teamwork has been fragmented through the
		  years, and the findings are generally unable to be used
		  practically. This article argues that it is possible to
		  boil down what researchers know about teamwork into five
		  core components that the authors submit as the “Big
		  Five” in teamwork. The core components of teamwork
		  include team leadership, mutual performance monitoring,
		  backup behavior, adaptability, and team orientation.
		  Furthermore, the authors examine how these core components
		  require supporting coordinating mechanisms (e.g., shared
		  mental modes, closed-loop communication, and mutual trust)
		  and vary in their importance during the life of the team
		  and the team task. Finally, the authors submit a set of
		  propositions for future research. }

    cascades of finite state automata over both surface text and syntactic
    dependency graphs. Support for syntactic patterns allow us to concisely
    define relations that are otherwise difficult to express in languages such
    as Common Pattern Specification Language (CPSL), which are currently
    limited to shallow linguistic features. The interaction of lexical and
    syntactic automata provides robustness and flexibility when writing
    extraction rules. This paper describes Odin{'}s declarative language for
    writing these cascaded automata.",
