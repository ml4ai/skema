Computational models are powerful tools for exploring and verifying hypotheses about complex systems. However, the scientific knowledge that drives their creation and results from their use is largely fractured among a number of different media, and the model implementations themselves are often difficult to share, extend and maintain.  The Scientific Knowledge Extraction and Model Assembly (SKEMA) framework aims to make fundamental contributions to machine-assisted knowledge discovery, curation, and modeling.

The SKEMA project is supported by DARPA under contract HR00112290092.
