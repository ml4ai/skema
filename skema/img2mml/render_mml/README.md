# MathML and LaTeX Comparison Visualization

This folder contains:

1. **Mathpix Annotator**: A script to post our images to [Mathpix](https://docs.mathpix.com/#introduction) and retrieve Mathpix's OCR annotations for the images.
2. **OCR Hub**: A landing page that contains links to the Mathpix OCR Tweak-er and the OCR Verify web apps.

In general, it should be okay to skip to the OCR Hub usage section since the Mathpix Annotator doesn't need to be run unless we are regenerating Mathpix's OCR results.

## Mathpix Annotator

A script to post our images to Mathpix and retrieve Mathpix's OCR annotations for the images. This has already been run once and the results from Mathpix have been stored.

**NOTE:** It should NOT be re-run unless we need Mathpix to annotate our images again. The code that queries Mathpix's API has been commented out and should only be uncommented and run if we really need to.

### Usage

1. Create a file called `config.py` in `mathpix_annotation/` and save your `MATHPIX_API_KEY`.
2. Run `main.ipynb`. The code will reuse the results stored from the previous run instead of re-querying Mathpix. To have it regenerate the results from the API uncomment the relevant sections (ONLY IF NEEDED).

### Generated Files

1. `mathpix_full_results.json`: Raw results from Mathpix.
2. `mathpix_errors.json`: Files for which Mathpix returned errors.
3. `mathpix_ocr_tweaker_data.json`: Trimmed Mathpix results sorted in increasing order of confidence to be used in Text Tweak-er.

### Other Files

1. `main.ipynb`: Driver code for the Mathpix Annotator script.
2. `batchRequestHandler`: A helper class for making Mathpix batch requests.
3. `image_ids.json`: A JSON with the IDs for the images being posted.

## OCR Hub

A landing page that contains links to the Mathpix OCR Tweak-er and the OCR Verify web apps. The latter web apps do the following:

- Mathpix OCR Tweak-er: A webapp to individually visualize the Mathpix annotations and make any manual corrections required. Both the LaTeX code and the MathML code generated by Mathpix can be manually corrected to match the original image here.
- OCR Verify: A webapp to visualize the OCR results of our own model and compare the output MathML to the original image. (Currently using placeholder data)

### Usage

```[bash]
cd ocr_hub
pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs FastAPI
uvicorn main:app # Runs the webapp
```

The app should now be running. View it on [localhost:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

### Files

- `static/` - Contains the HTML, JS and CSS for the sites.
- `main.py` - Contains the backend api.
- `data/` - The data stores for each webapp..
