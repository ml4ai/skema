For European countries, we relied on data and the setting-specific contact matrices developed in Fumanelli et al.23 that covers 26 countries. Unfortunately, Poland, and Belgium, which are included in the POLYMOD study14 used to calibrate the overall contact matrix are not included in ref. 23. We perform a multiple linear regression analysis to find the k such that the resulting Mij best fits the empirical data. values of ω Note that the empirical matrices derived in refs. 14,18 describe the average number of contacts of age j for an individual of age i, and in \\\"Methods\\\" we show how ωk is related to an average number of contacts 〈c〉 per individual. The regression yields 4.11 contacts (standard error, SE 0.41) in the household setting, 11.41 contacts (SE 0.27) in schools, 8.07 contacts (SE 0.52) in workplaces, and 2.79 contacts (SE 0.48) for the general community setting. It is worth remarking that for household contacts is larger than the average household size. This likely reflects the definition of contacts at home (rather than with household members) used in the POLYMOD study14 that has been used to calibrate the weights. The rationale for using the POLYMOD and the Russian studies14,18 in estimating the weights used to assemble the setting-specific synthetic matrices lies in the extensive validation of those contact patterns in epidemiological studies of a set of airborne infectious diseases, including influenza29,35–39. the estimated weight Our approach provides overall best matching ω k and that, in principle, some of the differences in the social behavior of specific countries may not be captured by this approach. For this reason, as a validation of this calibration method, in Fig. 3a we report the correlation between the resulting synthetic matrices for France, Japan, and the Shanghai Province of China and the available empirical matrices for these additional locations30–32.

A more detailed discussion is reported in Supplementary Information. If we consider the US state of New York as a reference and compute the distance from all other locations to it, a geographical pattern clearly emerges (Fig. 5b). Indeed, the contact patterns in most states of the US, and the urbanized areas of Canada and Australia appear to be very closely related to the one inferred for New York. In contrast, most of India, South Africa, and of the territories in Canada, Russia, and Australia have contact patterns noticeably different from those obtained for the state of New York. into after coming Epidemiological relevance. To investigate the effect of the computed contact matrices on infection transmission dynamics, we develop an age-structured SIR model to describe influenza transmission dynamics in the sites considered. The SIR model describes the spread of influenza in terms of the transition of individuals between different epidemiological compartments. Susceptible individuals (i.e., those at risk of acquiring the infection—S) can become infectious (i.e., capable to transmit the infection—I) contact with infectious individuals. Subsequently, infectious individuals recover from the infection and become removed (R) after a certain amount of time (the infectious period).
