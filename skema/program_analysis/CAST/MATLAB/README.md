# Tree-sitter MATLAB parser integration
MATLAB is now supported as a tree-sitter grammar for Linux and MacOs operating systems.
Files 'grammar.js', 'scanner.c', and the test corpus were sourced externally:
- Repository:  https://github.com/acristoffers/tree-sitter-matlab 
- License (MIT): https://github.com/acristoffers/tree-sitter-matlab/blob/main/LICENSE

## Supporting scripts

### clean_grammar
- Remove all files generated by previous builds

### build_grammar
- Build the grammar from source within this repository
  
### test_grammar
- Test the grammar using the test corpus

## Parsing MATLAB code
- First build and test the grammar
- Then execute the following
- ```tree-sitter parse <your_matlab_file.m>```
- If successful you will see the tree-sitter output stream with no errors reported
